# Image Processing Toolbox

## Overview
The Image Processing Toolbox is a comprehensive GUI-based tool for performing various image processing tasks. It allows users to open an image and apply multiple transformations and filters such as grayscale conversion, blurring, sharpening, contrast enhancement, edge detection, feature detection, rotation, and mirroring. The toolbox is designed to be user-friendly and provides easy access to common image processing operations.

## Features
- Open Image: Load an image file (JPEG, PNG, BMP) into the toolbox.
- Grayscale Conversion: Convert the loaded image to grayscale.
- Blur: Apply a Gaussian blur to the image.
- Sharpen: Enhance the sharpness of the image.
- Increase Contrast: Adjust the contrast of the image.
- Edge Detection: Perform edge detection using Sobel or Canny methods.
- Feature Detection: Detect features using Harris or SIFT methods.
- Rotate 90Â°: Rotate the image by 90 degrees.
- Mirror: Horizontally mirror the image.
- Reset: Reset the image to its original state.
- Save Image: Save the processed image in various formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP).
